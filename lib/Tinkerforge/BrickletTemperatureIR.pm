sub get_ambient_temperature
{
=comment
        Returns the ambient temperature of the sensor. The value
        has a range of -400 to 1250 and is given in 째C/10,
        e.g. a value of 423 means that an ambient temperature of 42.3 째C is 
        measured.
        
        If you want to get the ambient temperature periodically, it is recommended 
        to use the callback :func:`AmbientTemperature` and set the period with 
        :func:`SetAmbientTemperatureCallbackPeriod`.

sub get_object_temperature
{
=comment
        Returns the object temperature of the sensor, i.e. the temperature
        of the surface of the object the sensor is aimed at. The value
        has a range of -700 to 3800 and is given in 째C/10,
        e.g. a value of 3001 means that a temperature of 300.1 째C is measured
        on the surface of the object.
        
        The temperature of different materials is dependent on their `emissivity 
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity>`__. The emissivity of the material
        can be set with :func:`SetEmissivity`.
        
        If you want to get the object temperature periodically, it is recommended 
        to use the callback :func:`ObjectTemperature` and set the period with 
        :func:`SetObjectTemperatureCallbackPeriod`.

sub set_emissivity
{
=comment
        Sets the `emissivity <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity>`__ that is
        used to calculate the surface temperature as returned by 
        :func:`GetObjectTemperature`. 
        
        The emissivity is usually given as a value between 0.0 and 1.0. A list of
        emissivities of different materials can be found 
        `here <http://www.infrared-thermography.com/material.htm>`__.
        
        The parameter of :func:`SetEmissivity` has to be given with a factor of
        65535 (16-bit). For example: An emissivity of 0.1 can be set with the
        value 6553, an emissivity of 0.5 with the value 32767 and so on.
        
        .. note::
         If you need a precise measurement for the object temperature, it is
         absolutely crucial that you also provide a precise emissivity.
        
        The default emissivity is 1.0 (value of 65535) and the minimum emissivity the
        sensor can handle is 0.1 (value of 6553).

        Returns the response expected flag for the function specified by the

        For getter functions this is enabled by default and cannot be disabled,
        because those functions will always send a response. For callback
        configuration functions it is enabled by default too, but can be
        disabled via the set_response_expected function. For setter functions
        it is disabled by default and can be enabled.

        Enabling the response expected flag for a setter function allows to
        detect timeouts and other error conditions calls of this setter as
        well. The device will then send a response for this purpose. If this
